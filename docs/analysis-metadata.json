    "Storage Account Management (connect, list, delete)",
    "File Metadata Synchronization (automatic and manual triggers)",
    "Cross-cloud File Listing, Search, and Duplicate Detection (mode-aware)",
    "Secure handling of cloud provider tokens (encryption at rest)",
    "Refactored backend to use `AuthHandler` instance methods for JWT management",
    "Updated frontend to support new authentication flows, 2FA, and mode selection UI",
    "Resolved numerous frontend dependency and React Hook compatibility issues with Material-UI",
    "Corrected OAuth redirect handling for Google Drive and Dropbox"
  ],
  "technical_highlights": [
    "FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence",
    "React.js frontend with Material-UI for responsive UI",
    "PyOTP for TOTP generation and verification",
    "FastMail for asynchronous email sending (OTPs)",
    "Bcrypt for secure password hashing",
    "JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization (access and refresh tokens)",
    "OAuth 2.0 for delegated authorization with Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive",
    "Fernet (symmetric encryption) for sensitive token storage",
    "Background Tasks for non-blocking operations like file sync",
    "Robust error handling and logging across services",
    "Adherence to security best practices (CSRF protection, secure cookies, least privilege scopes)"
  ],
  "next_steps_recommendations": [
    "Implement Google Drive to Google Drive server-side migration as per detailed plan.",
    "Implement inter-cloud migration (e.g., Google Drive to Dropbox) considering server-side copy limitations.",
    "Develop a comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E) for all new features.",
    "Enhance storage usage and quota display on the frontend with real-time updates.",
    "Further refine UI/UX for file management (move, copy, rename) and job progress tracking.",
    "Explore advanced search functionalities and filters for files and duplicates.",
    "Implement file preview and download for Full Access Mode.",
    "Consider adding more cloud providers (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage)."
